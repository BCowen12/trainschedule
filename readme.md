The purpose of this app was to create a train scheduling program that displays a list of trains that have been saved to a Firebase databse and display when the next train is set to arrive in relation to your current time. You also have the ability to enter a new train with its start time and frequency of visits.

The app does the calculation for the time of the next train that will be coming and displays when it will be there and how many minutes away it is.

I utilized Moment.js to help with the times and used Firebase to store the entries.

When a user loads the page it will do the calculations to find when the next trains are going to arrive.
